# Overview
This is very lightweighted vagrant image for Hadoop big data lab. The total memory needed is only 4G (450M left after all service are started). It will take around 15 minutes to download and setup.

## Soft Installed
This distribution is compatible with [HDP 2.6.4](https://docs.hortonworks.com/HDPDocuments/HDP2/HDP-2.6.4/bk_release-notes/content/comp_versions.html), besides upgrade hive and hadoop to stable version.

## Quick Setup
1. Install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
1. Go to a proper folder and git clone this repository ```git clone https://github.com/datafibers/lab_env.git```
1. If you prefer to customize install config, you can modify the ```conf/install_config.sh or install_version.sh```
1. If you prefer to install specific config from branch, ```git checkout <branch_name>```
1. To install ```cd lab_env && vagrant up```
1. After installed, you'll need to run ```ops format``` to format hadoop for the very first time.
1. To update ```cd lan_env && git pull && vagrant provision```
